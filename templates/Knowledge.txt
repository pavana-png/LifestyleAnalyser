## Flask App Setup and Machine Learning Model Deployment

### Flask App Setup
- The code sets up a Flask web application.
- It loads a pre-trained machine learning model (a RandomForestRegressor) using joblib.
- Routes:
  - / (root) and /index.html to render HTML templates.
  - /predict to handle POST requests for making predictions using the loaded model.

### Machine Learning Model Training
- Loads lifestyle data from a CSV file (lifestyle_data.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Prepares the data by selecting features (age, calories, sleep, income, working_hours) and the target variable (healthy_life_percent).
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- Trains three regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and RandomForestRegressor.
- Evaluates each model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test set.
- Selects RandomForestRegressor as the final model due to its performance.

### Model Deployment
- Trains a RandomForestRegressor model on the entire dataset.
- Saves the trained model as a pickle file (lifestyle_model.pkl) using joblib.
